Omit regulation 25 of the Education (Pupil Referral Units) (Application of Enactments)\\n(England) Regulations 2007.\\n\\nEXPLANATORY NOTE\\n(This note is not part of the Regulations)\\n\\nThese Regulations deal with procedures to be adopted by governing bodies of all maintained\\nschools in England from 1st September 2013. They simplify the requirements that were previously\\nin the Education (Schoo! Government) (Terms of Reference) (England) Regulations 2000, the\\nEducation (Governors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Allowances) (England) Regulations 2003 and the School Governance\\n(Procedures) (England) Regulations 2003, all of which are revoked by these Regulations.\\n\\nPart 2 makes provision for the roles of the governing body and head teacher and replaces, in a\\nreduced form, requirements which were previously provided for in the Education (School\\nGovernment) (Terms of Reference) (England) Regulations 2000. It introduces 3 core functions on\\nwhich governing bodies should focus. Regulation 6(3) places a new obligation on governing\\nbodies to have regard to advice from the clerk to the governing body as to the nature of the\\ngoverning body\\'s functions.\\n\\nPart 3 deals with the appointment and removal of officers of the governing body, and their\\nfunctions. The main changes from the School Governance (Procedures) (England) Regulations\\n2003 are to simplify some of the requirements in relation to the setting of the chair\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and vice-\\nchair\\xe2\\x80\\x99s term of office in regulation 7 and to reduce the list of functions of the clerk to the\\ngoverning body in regulation 11.\\n\\nPart 4 provides for meetings and proceedings of the governing body. The main changes from the\\nprevious regulations include the provision at regulation 14(7}(d) that the proceedings of a\\ngoverning body are not invalidated by any person not having received written notice of the\\nmeeting or a copy of the agenda for the meeting. In addition, regulation 14(8) provides the\\ngoverning body may approve alternative arrangements for governors to participate or vote at\\nmeetings of the governing body including but not limited to by telephone or video conference. A\\nnumber of restrictions on a governing bedy delegating its functions have also been removed.\\n\\nPari 5 deals with the establishment and proceedings of committees of governing bodies.\\n\\nPart 6 deals with allowances to be paid to governors and associate members and replaces, in a\\nreduced form, requirements which were previously provided for in the Education Governors\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nAllowances) (England) Regulations 2003.\\n\\nRegulation 4 and Schedule 2 to these Regulations make amendments including to the School,\\nGovernance (Federations) (England) Regulations 2012 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Federations Regulations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The\\namendments to the Federations Regulations have the effect of applying these Regulations, with\\nmodifications, to governing bodies of federations.\\n\\nPart 7 and Schedule 2 to these Regulations make amendments to the Education (Pupil Referral\\nUnits) (Management Committees etc) (England) Regulations 2007 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe MCR\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) by applying\\nRegulation 2 and Parts 2 to 5 of, and Schedule 1 to these Regulations to management committees\\nof Pupil Referral Units. Section 19 of the Education Act 1996 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEA 1996\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) requires local\\n\\n(@) S11. 2007/2979, paragraph 1 to Schedule 3 of which was revoked by S.L 2008/3093. S.L2007/2979, was also amended by\\nS.12010/1074 (which was revoked by S.1. 2010/1919), SL 2012/1201, $.1 2012/1825 and S.1. 2012/3158.\\n\\n18\\nauthorities (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLAs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) to make arrangements for the provision of suitable education at school or\\notherwise than at school for those children of compulsory school age who, by reason of illness,\\nexclusion from school or otherwise may not for any period receive suitable education unless such\\narrangements are made for them. Any school established and maintained by a local authority\\nwhich is specially organised to provide education for such children is known as a Pupil Referral\\nUnit (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cunit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (see section 19 (2B) of EA 1996). Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to EA 1996 provides\\nfor adaptations and modifications of the application of enactments to units. Paragraph 15 of\\nSchedule 1 to EA 1996 provides that regulations may make provision for the delegation of LA\\nfunctions, or for the prohibition of delegation of LA functions, to the management committees of\\nunits.\\n\\nRegulation 31 provides that the MCR are amended as set out in Schedule 2. New regulation 21 of\\nthe MCR applies these Regulations to units with the modifications set out in the new Schedule 3 to\\nthe MCR.\\n\\nParagraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the EA 1996 provides that references in any enactment to the head\\nteacher of a school must be read in relation to a unit as a teacher in charge of the unit (whether\\nknown as the head teacher or not).\\n\\nA full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the\\nprivate or voluntary sectors is foreseen since the net impact is to reduce burdens and constraints on\\ngoverning bodies, and it will not impose any additional cost or increase the workload for schools\\nor local authorities.\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa9 Crown copyright 2013\\n\\nPrinted and published in the UK by The Stationery Office Limited under the authority and superintendence of Carol Tullo,\\nController of Her Majesty\\'s Stationery Office and Queen\\'s Printer of Acts of Parliament,\\n\\n19\\nISBN 978-0-71~110085\\xe2\\x80\\x941\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa35.75\\nUK2013070223 07/2013 19585\\n9\\xc2\\xb0780111\" 100851\\n\\nupafnw legislation gov.uk/id/uksi/20131624\\n'"

You may even wish to stipulate that particular\\nnamed Directors, or Directors representing particular stakeholder interests, must be present to constitute a\\nquorum.\\n\\n\\\\ Article 17 reflects paragraph 4 of Schedule | to the Regulations, which is required to be included in the\\narticles of all community interest companies.\\n\\n\"| You may wish to include a provision which gives the chair of the board a casting vote. This will enable the\\ndirectors to resolve any deadlock at board level.\\n\\n\\\\ Article 18 is designed to facilitate the taking of decisions by directors following discussions in the form of, for\\nexample, email exchanges copied to all the directors. Note the requirements as to recording the decision in\\narticles 18.2 and 32.\\n\\n\\\\3 The provisions in articles 19 and 20 reflect the position under the Companies Act 2006. However, it is\\nrecommended that, as a matter of good practice, all actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed in\\nwriting or at a meeting, as the case may be.\\n\\n\\\\\\xc2\\xa2 Private companies are obliged to have at least one director. Provisions can be inserted into the articles\\nproviding for a minimum number of directors. Where the company has just one director, that director must be a\\nnatural person. Article 12 notes that, where there is only one director, a majority decision is reached when that\\ndirector makes a decision. In the case of a single director, the quorum provisions (article 15) will need to be\\namended accordingly.\\n\\n13 The board of directors cannot remove a director other than in accordance with the provisions in article 23 and\\nthe Companies Act 2006,\\n\\n18 See the guidance on directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 remuneration in [Part 9] of the Regulator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information and guidance notes.\\n\\n17 See section 112 of the Companies Act 2006. A company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s members are (i) the subscribers to its\\nmemorandum; and (ii) every other person who agrees to become a member of the company and whose name is\\nentered in its register of members\\n\\n18 There is no need for all those who wish to become Members to subscribe to the Memorandum on\\nincorporation; they can become Members and be entered in the register of Members after the company has been\\nformed. However, since this model constitution assumes that all Members are also Directors, all Members will\\nalso have to be validly appointed as Directors under article 22.\\n\\n19 Inclusion of the provisions in article 26 (other than 26.3) is mandatory and reflects paragraphs 2(1)-(4) of\\nSchedule 1 to the Regulations. [Directors should ensure that the information to be included on an application\\n\\n16\\nform includes all the information which will be required to fill in Companies House Form [288a] on the\\nappointment of the new Member as a Director (see:\\nhitp://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/forms/generalForms/288.A pdf).] Article 26.3 provides that the Directors\\nare also members of the company.\\n20 Inclusion of the provisions of article 27.1 and 27.2.1 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 27.2.2 (reflecting sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) of\\nparagraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations), is mandatory.\\n21 The Companies Act 2006 has removed the need for private companies to hold annual general meetings and\\ntherefore these Articles follow suit; however, if you wish, you can insert an additional provision which obliges\\nthe company to hold annual general meetings.\\n\\xc2\\xbb Article 28.2 provides that general meetings must be held in accordance with the provisions of the Companies\\nAct 2006. You may insert additional provisions that specify how many Members are required to be present to\\nhold a valid general meeting. The quorum may be fixed in absolute terms (e.g. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfour Members\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) or as a\\nproportion of the total number of Members (e.g. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthree quarters of the Members from time to time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). You may\\neven wish to stipulate that particular named Members, or Members representing particular stakeholder interests,\\nmust be present to constitute a quorum. In any event, it is recommended that the quorum should never be less\\nthan half of the total number of Members.\\n?3 Inclusion of the provisions of article 28.3 (reflecting paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations) is\\nmandatory.\\n24 See the Companies House guidance booklet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccounts and Accounting Reference Dates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (available online at\\nif i .] On the annual community interest company,\\nreport, see [Part 8] of the Regulator\\xe2\\x80\\x99 8 information and guidance notes.\\n25 Section 1(1) of the Charities Act 2006 defines \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccharity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as an institution which \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis established for charitable\\npurposes only, and falls to be subject to the control of the High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction with\\nrespect to charities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n17\\nPiease ensure this form is placed at the tog of your application, if posted to\\nCorfipanies House, and the Company Name is consistent throughout all\\n\\nsocuments \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ;\\n_ Declarations on Formation of a\\n~~ Community Interest Company\\nFea ain: Company Name in full].
